# Capstone-Project-

This project is created as a part of The Data Science Specialization course. 


Course Tasks

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:


- Understanding the problem
- Data acquisition and cleaning

- Predictive modeling
- Creative exploration
- Creating a data product
- Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

The codes are written in R for capstone project.
